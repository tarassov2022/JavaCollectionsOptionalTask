P'lice, and auxil'ary,
The Garrison Artillery
They all commited suicide
Then the Bookies drew aside,
They seized it and harried it,
They picked it up and carried it
Hogan, Logan and all the bally crew,
Hagan, Fagan was students of psychology,
Swore they'd shift it with some dynamite
Cheered it, steered it to the winning place
The jockey who was riding, little John MacGee,
They bought it, brought it, then without apology
The Second Enniskillen's and the Life Guards too
He came to assist them, but still it wouldn't budge
The crowd began to cheer it. Then Rafferty, the judge
Well, the day Delaney's donkey won the halfmile race.
There was Riley pushing it, shoving it and shushing it
Was so thoroughly disgusted that he went to have his tea
The donkey gave a sneeze and blew the darn stuff out of sight
